# Reliable frequency regulation through vehicle-to-grid

This code and data supplement the article "Reliable frequency regulation through vehicle-to-grid" by Dirk Lauinger, François Vuille, and Daniel Kuhn, available at ... This project was funded by the [Institut VEDECOM](http://www.vedecom.fr/).

The code files are
1. `Main.py`,
2. `my_functions.py`.

The processed data files in the folder `Processed_data_excluding_frequency_deviations` are
1. `ds.h5`: vehicle state and power for driving in kW,
2. `pa.h5`: availability price with half hourly resolution from 2015 to 2019 in €/kW/h,
3. `pb.h5`: utility price with half hourly resolution from 2015 to 2019 in €/kWh,
4. `pr.h5`: regulation price with half hourly resolution from 2015 to 2019 in €/kW/h.

The file `delta_10s.h5` is 250MB large and excluded from this repository for space reasons. It can be constructed by running the jupyter notebook `Frequency.ipynb`.

The jupyter notebooks
1. `Availability_Price.ipynb`,
2. `Delivery_Price.ipynb`,
3. `Delivery_Payment.ipynb`,
4. `Driving.ipynb`,
5. `Frequency.ipynb`,
6. `Utility_Price.ipynb`

describe the creation of processed data from raw data.

The raw data stems from the French Transmission System Operator RTE and is linked to its source in the corresponding jupyter notebooks. For reproducibility, it is also included in this repository.
1. The availability price is in the excel files `Availability_2015` to `Availability_2019.
2. The delivery price is in the excel files `Delivery_2015` to `Delivery_2019`.
3. The frequency measurements are in the text files `RTE_Frequence_2015_01.txt` to `RTE_Frequence_2019_12.txt`.
4. The color of each day for the 'Tempo' pricing scheme is found in the excel files `Tempo_2014-2015.xlsx` to `Tempo_2019-2020.xlsx`.

The software used in this project was
1. Spyder 3.3.6 from the anaconda distribution with Python 3.6.9 64-bit and IPython 7.12.0,
2. JupyterLab 1.1.3,
3. Gurobi 9.0.0 with an academic license,
4. Gurobi's python interface `gurobipy`.

All numerical experiments were run on a workstation with 64GB RAM and an Intel i7-6700 CPU @ 3.40 GHz processor with a 64-bit operating system.
